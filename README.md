# Widget Simple Template with libraries
This is a simple widget template to help you get started which demonstrates how to load and use Widget Preferences as well as the basic file structure of a widget. 

It uses [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) to help create modular code and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to load the configuration and interact with the DOM
